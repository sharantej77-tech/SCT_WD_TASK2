This is a simple, elegant calculator web app. To deploy on Vercel, ensure the following files are present:

- `index.html`: Redirects root to calculator2.html
- `vercel.json`: Vercel configuration for routing

## Deploying to Vercel
1. Push this folder to a GitHub repository.
2. Import the repo in [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
3. No build step is needed; Vercel will serve the static files.
